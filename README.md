This repo contains the codes for the [TNNLS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03440.pdf). we propose a complex convolutional sparse coding (ComCSC) algorithm and its gradient regularized version (ComCSC-GR) for interferometric phase restoration. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The codes are modified from [SPORCO](http://brendt.wohlberg.net/software/SPORCO/) for adapting to complex images.

**10, 000 Monte-Carlo simulations for evaluating the compared methods on the expected values and standard deviations of step function approximation. The amplitude is constant and the coherence value is set as 0.3.**

## Usage

`train_cpx_dic.m` uses ComCSC and ComCSC-GR to train the complex convolutional dictionaries based on the simulated interferograms `train_cpxs.mat`.

`recon_peaks_cpx_comp.mlx` gives a demo using the learned convolutional dictionaries to restore the clean interferogram.
